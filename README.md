# MovieListProjectMVVM
This is the first project that I have tried to implement MVVM pattern. The project is dedicated to listing movies and series in different tabs. 
Users may list movies and series according to the media's rating, popularity or being on theatre property.
- The program is written on MVVM design.
- KingFisher package is used to fetch network images.
